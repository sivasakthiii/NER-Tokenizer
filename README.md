# Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Streamlit

This project demonstrates Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Tokenization using the spaCy library and deploys it globally using Streamlit.

## Overview

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying named entities such as people, organizations, locations, dates, etc., in a text. Tokenization, on the other hand, involves splitting a text into individual words or tokens.

This project provides a web interface built with Streamlit where users can input text, and the system will perform NER and Tokenization using the spaCy library.

## Deployment

The project is deployed globally using Streamlit. You can access it [here](https://share.streamlit.io/yourusername/nertokens/main/app.py)
